Tasks:

- Find the 9s using K-Nearest neighbours for Minkowski metric of order (1, 2, 3).
  - ... using Decision tree.
  - ... using Random Forests.
- Differentiate each digit with K-means clusters

Outcome:
The binary classification model tends to perform slightly better than the multi-class model. For example, accuracy was 96% for binary classification and 87% for multi-class.
This can be explained based on the nature of binary classification which requires the model to separate two classes in which decision boundary is easier to draw.
On the other hand, multi-class classification requires separating multiple classes --> more complex boundaries and greater potential for misclassification between classes
